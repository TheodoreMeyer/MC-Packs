# Security Policy
Packs will be supported through until Minecraft requires major changes to let it work.
Note that the release version will let you know when a minecraft version support is dropped
For example: if 1.0.1 is the last version that supports bedrock 1.19.1, then that will be supported as the last version for that.
Another Example: if 1.0.2+ doesn't support minecraft 1.19.1, but supports 1.20.1, it will tell you in the realeases and probabaly here.
