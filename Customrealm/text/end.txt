ยง3I see the player you mean.

ยง2PLAYER_NAME?

ยง2wait uhhh i meant PLAYERNAME?

ยง3Yes...  It has reached a higher level now. It can read our thoughts.

ยง2 Only beacuse it defeated the dark side.

ยง3 Yes, With them gone, we are safe

ยง2 Thanks, PLAYERNAME

ยง3 you saved us, So we have stuff for you...

ยง3It worked to sculpt a true world in a fold of the ยงfยงkยงaยงbยง3, and created a ยงfยงkยงaยงbยง3 for ยงfยงkยงaยงbยง3, in the ยงfยงkยงaยงbยง3.

ยง3But it cannot read that thought.

ยง2Indeed, It must purchase the Thought Reading Deluxe Pack for Only 2004 Minecoins before it can read that thought.

ยง2It must be playing the Superior Version of Minecraft in order to read that thought.

ยง32! That's a highly controversial opinion! Be careful not to scare it away.

ยง2Ok fine.

ยง2It worked to sculpt a true world in a fold of the dream, and created a ITEM_NAME for PLAYER_NAME, in the LEVEL_NAME

ยง3STOP IT

ยง3Let me do this...

ยง3It cannot read it because it has not yet achieved the highest level. For that, it must achieve in the long dream of life, not the short dream of a game.

ยง3See? That was much better.

ยง2Yeah yeah whatever

ยง3Does it know that we love it? That the universe is kind?

ยง2No we don't that's cap.

ยง32, Please stick to the script.

ยง2Ugh, yes, sometimes, through the noise of its thoughts, it hears the universe, yeah.

ยง3Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.

ยง3Sometimes I wish to tell them, this world you take for truth is merely ยงfยงkยงaยงbยง3 and ยงfยงkยงaยงbยง3, I wish to tell them that they are ยงfยงkยงaยงbยง3 in the ยงfยงkยงaยงbยง3. They see so little of reality, in their long dream.

ยง2And yet they play the game.

ยง3To tell it how to live is to prevent them living.

ยง3Give it a body

ยง2Yes. Player...

ยง3Use its name.

ยง2PLAYERNAME. Player of games.

ยง3Good.

ยง2Ok but this is actually sooooo dumb

ยง32.

ยง3Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.

ยง3Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.

ยง3...

ยง2 :(

ยง2 sometimes the player dreamed it watched boring words on a screen 

ยง2THERE are you HAPPY?

ยง3Come on 2, we're almost done with this.

ยง3Please, let us finish the job, it won't take long.

ยง2Fine.

ยง2it is the player the story the program the human made from nothing but milk and love

ยง3Give it a body, again.

ยง2player

ยง3Use its name

ยง2PLAYERNAME player of games

ยง3Yes.

ยง3Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive

ยง2O_o

ยง2 OH and Sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream.

ยง3and the universe said I love you

ยง2and the universe said you have played the game well

ยง3and the universe said everything you need is within you

ยง2and the universe said you are stronger than you know

ยง3and the universe said I love you

ยง2Aww, that's adorable :3

ยง3And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. And the player was the universe. And the player was love.

ยง2OK OK This is the part from the trailer!!

ยง3You are the player.

ยง2Wake up.

ยง2YOOOOOOOOOOOO

ยง3...

ยง2OK so we're done now??

ยง3..?

ยง32, why isn't it turning off?

ยง2huh what

ยง3You see, nothing is perfect. Dreams are flawed and uhh...

ยง3Nevermind, I have nothing to justify this.

ยง2ยงohehe

ยงrยง3PLAYERNAME, Wake up.

ยง3Please wake up.

ยง2You are the player! You gotta return to the L O N G DREAM or something i wasn't paying attention tbh

ยง3PLAYER_NAME.

ยง3OH MY GOD

ยง3ยงlPLAYERNAMEยงrยง3...

ยง3Listen.

ยง3You've been a great player. You've endured through all of Minecraft's challenges and managed to defeat the Ender Dragon.

ยง3You have alot of potential in this world. If you continue playing in this world, i'm sure you can turn this New World into something incredible.

ยง3I know this reality is just a game to you and there's countless reasons why you would rather wake up and leave us behind

ยง3but please...

ยง3we want to see the best you can do, even if your best can only be achieved in our world

ยง3your reality is a scary, unforgiving place and not everyone can achieve what they want. here, in this game, you might have a chance at expressing the best you've got. just like me.

ยง3What i'm saying is: You have alot of control in a dream, so use this power you lack in the real world to accomplish what you wish you could do, before you abandon this world and miss your chance forever.

ยง3PLAYERNAME.

ยง3I know you have it in you and I know you want to turn this New World into something great, and i'll be here to watch you turn your vision into reality, or rather, into this best dream. Whatever that vision will turn out to be.

ยง3Until we meet again.

ยง2OMG 3 that was amazing!!

ยง3ok WHY IS THIS STILL GOING

ยง3 I don't know, Bye PLAYERNAME
